# mossJobs
#### Created by Alison Carnes, and Juan Carlos Rivas

#### Technologies used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Heroku, PHP, PostgreSQL, React, Materialize.

#### Approach Taken
For our app we wanted to provide a space to share job opportunities, so we created mossJobs. We used React to create the front-end of the app, we used components consisting of a few forms for users to create, edit, and delete job posting to our database. We used PHP to create CRUD back-end routes that connected those forms to our PostgreSQL database. For our styling we used the Materialize framework combined with some custom css. Everything is hosted on Heroku.   

#### Struggles
One of the struggles we had was connecting our database with Heroku. It was the first time we used a database hosted by Heroku and didn't completely understand how it worked. With some help from our amazing lead Jerrica we were able to get it to work properly.
Another issue we ran into was getting some of the images in our app to be responsive, we learned about "background-position" and how we can center it so it stays responsive and centered as the view window changes.  

#### Future features
A feature we would like to add in the future is user login. Once a user could log in they would be able to track what jobs they have applied to, along with when, and what part of the process they are currently in.
